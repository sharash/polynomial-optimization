# Polynomial Optimization using Linear Programming and Random Sampling

This repo contains a short demonstration of optimizing a polynomial function with polynomial constraints using linear programming and random sampling. The problem is inspired by an example from Ryan Oâ€™Donnell's TCS course at CMU.
