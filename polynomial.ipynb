However, we can get around this problem as follows: randomly sample a number of points $x_i$, and evaluate our constraints at those points; the resulting set of constraints are used to formulate and solve a linear program, which approximates the exact solution well."

    "With the random sampling we have obtained a good approximation of the optimal solution, and if we round off the small decimals we can start to discern some patterns in the coefficients. We see that for degree $2k$ the coefficients are the same as for degree $2k-1$, with the exception of degree 2. Looking closer, we might notice that the polynomial of degree $2k-1$ is the [Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials) of degree $2k-1$ (up to a change in sign, which might flip to maximize $b$). Subsequently, we can use the following fact about Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind: in general \n",
